This folder will house python scripts that I used throughout my time as an RA. Python was used primarily for scraping
and for accessing data from APIs.

1. pull_DrillingInfo.py - This code allows one to pull data from DrillingInfo.com's Direct Access API. These data are not free and this     code will only be functional when you insert your API_key and Client_ID in the proper places (instructions in the script)
2. pull_UN_trade.py - This code allows one to pull data from the United 
Nations Trade Database
